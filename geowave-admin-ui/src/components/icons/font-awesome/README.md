This folder contains a subset of FontAwesome icon definitions taken from
https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome and embedded inside of dirt-simple
React components.

This was done because the existing alternatives are either (arguably)
over-engineered (i.e., SVG-based React component libraries with numerous
transitive dependencies and/or significant code/build overhead) or involve
loading more icons than necessary (i.e, webfont + global CSS).
